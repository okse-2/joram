      <subtitle>18th June 2002: Branch of the Test Suite to add JMS
        1.1 support</subtitle>
      <p>The CVS repository of the Test Suite has been branched to
        support JMS 1.1 tests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the main branch of CVS will be for JMS 1.1 tests</li>
        <li>the branch <em>jms-1.0.2b</em> will be for JMS 1.0.2b
          ones</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, contributions and feedbacks for both tests are
        still welcome. If tests are right for both JMS specifications,
        they will be added to the 2 branches.<br />

        information, see the <a href="doc.html">documentation</a></p>

      <subtitle>15th April 2002: Test Suite web pages and package available</subtitle>
      <p>The Test Suite has now its own web pages. Any feedback is
        welcome</p>
      <p>As requested by some people, the Test Suite is now also
        available as a <a href="../download/tests.tgz">package</a>.</p>
    </s1>
    <s1 name="About">
      <p>This Test Suite is available under LGPL.
        it tests JMS<sup>TM</sup> features and its code base is
        <em>pure JMS<sup>TM</sup> without dependency from any vendor</em>.
      </p>
      <p>Technically, the administration step is done through a simple interface
        that any provider can implement. For the moment, we provide
        implementations for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.objectweb.org/joram/">JORAM</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.pramati.com/">Pramati</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.ashnasoft.com/">AshnaMQ</a></li>
        <li><a
            href="http://fiorano.com/best_cgi/frame.cgi?target=products/fmq_tour.htm">FioranoMQ</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>(a <a
          href="http://www.swiftmq.com/">SwiftMQ</a> one will be provided 
        soon).
      </p>
      <p>We suggest that other JMS providers implement this
        interface so that the suite can be used by potential users to test
        implementations with respect to well known test scenarios.
      </p>
