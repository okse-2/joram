      <s2 name="May 07, 2010: JORAM 5.3.1 maintenance release is available">
      <p>This release introduces some improvements and bug fixes, essentially:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A reworked PoolNetwork component with one Sender by NetSession. This optimizes
        performances and fixes various synchronization issues. Furthermore, SoftReferences
        are now used in the PoolNetwork to avoid memory errors when messages accumulate in
        the network.</li>
        <li>Interceptors can now be configured for managed connection factories.</li>
        <li>Bug fixes in JMS bridge allowing anew the use of persistent server (a configuration
        parameter is now required to enable XAConnection).</li>
			  <li>Bug fix about destination using Timer. These destinations are now locked in memory
        and the Timer tasks are handled depending of the agent life-cycle.</li>
        <li>Potential bug fix in heart-beat handling. Previously an exception in HeartBeatTask.start
        method caused an Engine stop.</li>
        <li>Potential bug fix avoiding deadlock in AdminModule.stopServer of local server.</li>
        <li>Changes configuration properties naming for NGTransaction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This version is available for <a href="http://joram.ow2.org/download/index.html">download</a>, and in Maven
      repository.</p>
      <p>It is tagged in SVN (JORAM_5_3_1), the complete list of changes can be viewed either in

      <s2 name="March 09, 2010: Joram successfully passes performance and scalability tests for SM&amp;C.">
      <p>The CNES implementation of a new generation of Spacecraft Monitoring and Control system (CCSDS SM&amp;C stantard)
      foresee to use Joram as underlying communication middleware. Performance and scalability tests have been conducted
      successfully to validate this future usage of Joram.</p>
      <p>Credits to HP &amp; <a href="http://www.oxalya.com">Oxalya</a> and their Minalogic partnership for their support
      in granting access to the 'virtual nodes' cluster.</p>
      </s2>

      <s2 name="March 05, 2010: Tutorials about OSGi and architecture designer are available.">
      <p>Two new tutorials are available describing new features available in Joram 5.3. The first one describes
      briefly the capabilities of the OSGi implementation of the Joram server, the second one introduces the Joram's
      architecture designer (see <a href="doc/tutorials.html">tutorials</a>).</p>
      </s2>

      <s2 name="February 22, 2010: JORAM 5.3.0 is released">
      <p>This version is available for <a href="http://joram.ow2.org/download/index.html">download</a>, and in Maven
      repository.</p>
      <p>Joram is now designed with an OSGi<sup>TM</sup> based services architecture to provide a dynamically adaptable
      messaging server:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Joram server can be launched as a set of OSGi bundles (it is always possible to launch the server as
        a classic Java program).</li>
        <li>Additional services can be started, stopped, reconfigured: Command line interface, Web console, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This release also introduces some improvements and bug fixes, essentially:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Update Joram security JAAS implementation.</li>
        <li>Implements either implicit (periodic) or explicit behavior for monitoring topics.</li>
        <li>Implements monitoring queue.</li>
			  <li>The Destination.getStatistics method now returns all the convertible JMX attributes of this destination.</li>
        <li>Fix a possible incomplete closure of PoolSender, and possible NPE.</li>
        <li>JMX monitoring extensions.</li>
        <li>Fix potential issues using clustered destination.</li>
        <li>No longer use Joram's implementation of timer.</li>

	      <p>A two-day training session about JORAM is scheduled in Grenoble; it will be delivered in french language.</p>
	      <p>The session is entitled "Design and Deploy a Distributed JORAM Messaging System".</p>
	      <p>This training session is targeted at architects and system designers that intend to integrate  the JORAM component
	      within a global distributed solution. It includes a significant part of  experimentations and case studies based on
	      real-world application scenarios.</p>
	      <p>The session is conducted by ScalAgent Distributed Technologies, the leading developer of the JORAM component. We
	      offer to share our expertise through a training session aiming at providing the key knowledge to use and deploy a JORAM
	      system that fits your own requirements. This two-day session details the design principles of JORAM and describes the
	      best practices that will enable to take advantage of its advanced properties for complex networked environments.</p>

      This will be built automatically from the current development code after each change in the SVN code base.</p>
      <p>If you need quickly a fix for a particular bug, you may be able to find a fixed Joram release here well
      before the fix makes it into the next release version. On the other hand, these snapshots might sometimes
      be unstable.</p>
