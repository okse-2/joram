    <s1 name="JORAM History">

      <subtitle>November 7, 2003: JORAM finaly includes a graphical
      administration tool in its 3.7 release!</subtitle>
      <p>Thanks to Alexander Fedorowicz, an active JORAM contributor,
      the long expected graphical tool
      for administering and monitoring the state of a JORAM platform is
      finaly available.</p>
      <p>This tool allows to administer and monitor a JORAM platform made of
      one or many interconnected JORAM servers. It allows to create and delete
      destinations, users, and also to bind them to JORAM's naming server.</p>
      <p>The tool sources are available in CVS and in the sources package. It
      is provided as an independent library in the binary distribution.
      </p>
      <p>This latest release is also available through a CVS checkout, tag
        <strong>joram3_7_0</strong>.</p>

      <subtitle>August 7, 2003: JORAM 3.6 connects J2ME devices!</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.6 follows the 3.4 release in addressing the opening of the
      JORAM platform to <strong>heterogenous</strong> client applications. Where
      JORAM 3.4, with the support of SOAP as client communication protocol,
      opened the platform to non-Java applications, the 3.6 release, with
      its new kJORAM libraries, allows J2ME applications to use JORAM messaging
      functionnalities. A J2ME application is a lightweight Java application
      deployed and running on a mobile device such as a PDA or a smart
      phone.</p>
      <p>kJORAM is available in specific packages and also by checking out
      the <strong>joram</strong> CVS module, tag <strong>joram3_6_0</strong>.
      </p>

      <subtitle>June 24th, 2003: JORAM 3.5 is available.</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.5 is available in the CVS repository (joram3_5_0 tag) as well
      as packaged. This version is based on the 3.4 release and includes
      the <strong>SOAP</strong> proxy.
      On top of that, it provides a totally refactored <strong>message
      persistence</strong> management.
      </p>
      <p>The latest 3.4 update (joram3_4_3) has also been packaged.</p>
      <p>JORAM is now released under the <strong>LGPL</strong> licence.</p>

     <subtitle>March 19th, 2003: new JORAM releases.</subtitle>
     <p>JORAM 3.3 is now available as a packaged version.
     As a reminder, it provides a new administration implementation. In CVS it
     is now tagged joram3_3_1. Compared to joram3_3_0, it is a maintenance
     version, correcting a few bugs.
     </p>
     <p>JORAM 3.4 is available only in the CVS distribution. This
     release tagged joram3_4_0 supports the SOAP protocol as a link between
     a Joram client and a Joram platform. It rearchitectures the JMS proxy
     server side, and the JMS connection client side, for supporting multiple 
     protocols (currently TCP and SOAP).</p>

     <subtitle>December 11th, 2002: a new JORAM version tagged 3_3_0 is
      available in the CVS distribution.</subtitle>
      <p>This new version provides a totally refactored <strong>administration</strong> 
      protocol. Administration is now based on JMS communication and is much
      more flexible than the past implementation. Hopefully it will make
      contributing easier; JORAM's administration still misses graphical tools
      and JMX support, and any contribution would be highly appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>This new administration implementation comes with a new administration
      interface. Old administration codes should go on working even if they now
      use deprecated methods. 
      </p>

     <subtitle>October 21st, 2002: JORAM 3.2 provides new features!</subtitle>
      <p>The main added values of Joram 3.2.0 are the new implementations of
         <strong>hierarchical topics</strong> and <strong>dead message queues</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>According to the JMS specification, topics might have a hierarchical
         structure allowing clients to subscribe or publish to given subtopics.
         Joram's fully distributed structure allows a topic hierarchy to be
         spread over many servers.
      </p>
      <p>A dead message queue is a destination getting undeliverable messages.
         Messages might be considered undeliverable because they expired 
         before delivery, because they were sent on a non accessible
         destination or because they are constantly denied when consumed.
      </p>
      <p>This new version also provides a <strong>flow control mechanism</strong> in
         order to prevent a Joram platform to be overloaded by a heavily
         producing client.
      </p>

     <subtitle>June 10th, 2002: JORAM now implements the new JMS 1.1
        specification!</subtitle>
      <p><strong>Joram 3.1.0 fully implements JMS 1.1</strong> providing unified
        messaging interfaces for the Point-to-Point and Pub/Sub
        domains. In the previous versions of Joram and JMS, the
        client programming model made a strong distinction between
        these two domains. Now, the domain unification simplifies
        the model and allows to include PTP and Pub/Sub messaging in
        a same transaction.</p>
      <p>No need to modify existing applications: code written for
        the previous Joram and JMS versions will work as is with
        these new versions.</p>
      

      <subtitle>7th june 2002: JORAM 3.0.4 available (cvs tag: joram3_0_4-1)</subtitle>
      
      <p>
        This version is a maintenance version of JORAM, it includes
        corrections of bugs in XA and ASF classes. 
        The JORAM CVS repository has been branched after this release:
        next version of JORAM will implement JMS 1.1. The branch
        corresponding to JMS 1.0.2b is jms1_0_2b. 
      </p>


      <subtitle>26th March 2002: JORAM 3.0.1 available (cvs tag: joram3_0_1)</subtitle>
      
      <p>
	This version corrects all bugs discovered by JORAM community
	since the release of JORAM 3.0.0. These corrections were already available
	in CVS repository.
      </p>


      <subtitle>20th March 2002: JMS Test Suite released</subtitle>

      <p><strong>A JMS Test Suite</strong> has been released under LGPL.<br />
	This suite tests JMS features. All code of the test suite is
	pure JMS without any dependency to JORAM.</p>

      <subtitle>11th March 2002: JORAM 3.0.0 available (cvs tag: joram3_0_0)</subtitle>
      
      <p>
	Compared to JORAM previous versions, this new release is a complete
	re-factoring of the code base. It gets rid of the
	previous limitations and defects. The JMS specification is now fully
	implemented, JORAM provides authentication and security
	features, and introduces a distributed implementation of the Topic
	destination. Its clean and sound code basis guarantees fast
	and easy future developements and enhancements.<br/>
	A suite of tests based on JUnit will be very soon proposed for
	download.
      </p>
