      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java implementation of <strong>JMS API</strong>
   	  specification.<br></br>
      It provides access to a really distributed MOM (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the
      <a href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent D.T.</a> <strong>AAA</strong> or <strong>A3</strong>
      agents based platform:</p>

      </ul>
      
      <p>Joram is now designed with an OSGi<sup>TM</sup> based services architecture to provide a dynamically adaptable
      messaging server:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Joram server can be launched as a set of OSGi bundles (it is always possible to launch the server as
        a classic Java program).</li>
        <li>Additional services can be started, stopped, reconfigured: Command line interface, Web console, etc.</li>
      </ul>

	  <p>Joram can carry many plugins (AMQP, MQTT, Stomp, etc.) and become a multi-protocol gateway.</p>
	  
      <p>Stable versions of JORAM are JMS 1.1 and 2.0 compliant. Moreover embedded in a JEE server, JORAM has passed
      all tests concerning JMS certification in the Java EE certification TCK.</p>

      <p>At the request of a user we conducted a study on the stability of JoramMQ / MQTT under stress conditions
      including a very high throughput of messages and an extremely large number of clients.</p>
      <p>The goal of this benchmark is to demonstrate the vertical scalability of the JoramMQ server using a simple VM.
      The VM used during the tests was a 4 VCPU with 16Gb running CentOS7.1 with no Linux kernel recompilation. Under these
      conditions JoramMQ/MQTT has successfully handled 750,000 concurrent connections.</p>

      <p>This <a href="http://jfsma14.lcis.fr/ressources/presentations/Slides_AFreyssinet.pdf">presentation</a> details the technological core
      of Joram: the distributed execution engine implements a reactor pattern, where agents communicate exclusively through events and react to
      events atomically. This technology enables ScalAgent&#145;s agents to interact effortlessly, be they located on the same system or on different
      ones.</p>
      <p>It is at the core of several of our products, Joram or JoramMQ, the monitoring/control solutions developed for the CNES, or
      the mediation solution of TagSys RFID.</p>

      <p>CNES (the french space agency) has organized a workshop on 18th September about mobility for

      Internet. This could be for controlling a satellite, or for managing scientific on-board instruments.
      The topic covers also cooperative missions which involve several agencies and other entities.</p>
      <p>David Féliot will be there for <a href="http://www.scalagent.com">ScalAgent D.T.</a> to present the
      interest of the MQTT technology in this context, and the value of the MQTT implementation in JoramMQ
