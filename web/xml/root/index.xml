      <subtitle>May 3, 2004: JORAM users' day announcement</subtitle>
      <p>ObjectWeb and the JORAM core development team are setting up
      a JORAM Users' Day on June 17th in Paris (place to be defined later).</p>
      <p>This day is intended to be the first attempt of direct exchanges
      between members of the JORAM community. The meeting is an opportunity
      to report on the credibility of the JORAM solution and to raise
      questions and answers about the durability and evolution of this open
      source product.</p>
      <p>Details about the JORAM Users Day can be found
      <a href="current/doc/JORAM-Day.pdf">here</a>.</p>
      <p>A french version of this annoucement is also available at:

      <subtitle>February 13, 2004: JORAM 4.0 is released and provides major
      new features!</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 4.0 is the first release of a new JORAM generation with even
      more features and architecturing capabilities.</p>
      <p>This new version introduces the following new
      functionnalities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Collocated communication protocol</strong>: when a client
        and its JORAM server run collocated in a same JVM, they may now
        communicate through a "local" optimised connection rather than a 
        TCP connection. This feature will highly impact the use of JORAM with
        JOnAS for example, when set as collocated.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distributed JNDI server</strong>: this latest version of
        JORAM's naming server may now be deployed on many JORAM servers, 
        so that naming information is accessible from multiple points. 
        Client applications do not depend anymore on a single central JNDI
        server.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Universal JMS bridge</strong>: JORAM may be configured
        for establishing a link to any JMS compliant foreign JMS provider.
        This feature allows JORAM client applications to actually communicate
        with foreign JMS destinations totally transparently.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Administration methods</strong> have been largely 
      modified for simplifying the evolution of management following
      the new JORAM releases. Old admin and monitoring classes
      have been kept but this will be temporary.</p>

      <p>This new version also introduces a <strong>new sources
      tree</strong>, which may be quickly described as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>com/scalagent</code>: sources of the kJoram client
        layer</li> 
        <li><code>fr/dyade/</code>: sources of the agent platform</li>
        <li><code>org/objectweb/joram</code>: sources of the MOM and JORAM
        client layers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The new packages are available in the 
      <a href="download/index.html">download area</a>. The CVS tag is
      <strong>joram4_0_0</strong>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="doc/index.html">documentation</a> has also largely been
      updated.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
