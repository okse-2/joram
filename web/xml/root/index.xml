      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java
      implementation of <strong>JMS</strong> (Java Message Service API
      released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.). It provides access to a MOM
      (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the <a
      href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent</a> agents based
      distributed platform.</p>
      <p> JORAM is an <strong>open source</strong> software released under
      the <strong>LGPL</strong> license.</p>

	<subtitle>January 7, 2005: JORAM 4.2 release candidate 1 is available</subtitle>
	<p>Joram 4.2 RC1 provides new features as high-avaibility, dynamic configuration, 
        and a lot of fixes and improvements.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>High Availability</strong> This version provides the active replication of JORAM clients, 
          JORAM servers and ScalAgent servers. It transparently handles network handover and server 
          failover. This version currently relies on JGroups.</li>
	  <li><strong>Dynamic Configuration</strong> This version provides a runtime mechanism enabling to 
          remotely add and remove Joram servers dynamically, at runtime, through the Administration API of JORAM.
          This great feature, combined with updated JMX implementation, initiates a new set of management facilities in JORAM
          </li>
	  <li><strong>Architecture and Performance improvements</strong>. This version packages a whole set of deep
          changes within the JORAM and ScalAgent architectures that lead to performance improvements compared to the 4.1 
          version. Those changes partially concern communication protocols and thus prevent backward compatibility with previous
          Joram versions. </li>
	</ul>
        <p>This version has been sponsored by France Telecom R&amp;D</p>

	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>The clustered queue feature provides a load-balancing mechanism. It is made up of several queues
	   exchanging messages depending on their load. This new feature is sponsored by France Telecom R&amp;D,
	   as will be the future High-Availability Joram server to be released in the next version. </li>
	</ul>
