      <subtitle>February 13, 2004: JORAM 4.0 is released and provides major
      new features!</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 4.0 is the first release of a new JORAM generation with even
      more features and architecturing capabilities.</p>
      <p>This new version introduces the following new
      functionnalities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Collocated communication protocol</strong>: when a client
        and its JORAM server run collocated in a same JVM, they may now
        communicate through a "local" optimised connection rather than a 
        TCP connection. This feature will highly impact the use of JORAM with
        JOnAS for example, when set as collocated.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distributed JNDI server</strong>: this latest version of
        JORAM's naming server may now be deployed on many JORAM servers, 
        so that naming information is accessible from multiple points. 
        Client applications do not depend anymore on a single central JNDI
        server.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Universal JMS bridge</strong>: JORAM may be configured
        for establishing a link to any JMS compliant foreign JMS provider.
        This feature allows JORAM client applications to actually communicate
        with foreign JMS destinations totally transparently.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Administration methods</strong> have been largely 
      modified for simplifying the evolution of management following
      the new JORAM releases. Old admin and monitoring classes
      have been kept but this will be temporary.</p>

      <p>This new version also introduces a <strong>new sources
      tree</strong>, which may be quickly described as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>com/scalagent</code>: sources of the kJoram client
        layer</li> 
        <li><code>fr/dyade/</code>: sources of the agent platform</li>
        <li><code>org/objectweb/joram</code>: sources of the MOM and JORAM
        client layers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The new packages are available in the 
      <a href="download/index.html">download area</a>. The CVS tag is
      <strong>joram4_0_0</strong>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="doc/index.html">documentation</a> has also largely been
      updated.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>

      <subtitle>November 7, 2003: the first major
      contribution from JORAM ever growing community</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.7 includes the long expected graphical tool for
      administering and monitoring the state of a JORAM platform.
      Thanks to Alexander Fedorowicz, an active contributor, this tool is
      made available to the whole JORAM community.</p>
      <p>The tool allows to administer and monitor a JORAM platform made of
      one or many interconnected JORAM servers. It allows to create and delete
      destinations, users, and also to bind them to JORAM's naming server.</p>
      <p>Many thanks to Alexander for providing this useful tool often
      requested on JORAM's mailing lists.</p>

      is provided as an independent library in the binary distribution. Check
      the <a href="download/index.html">download area</a>.
      </p>
      <p>This latest release is also available through a CVS checkout, tag
        <strong>joram3_7_0</strong>.</p>
      <p>The installation, administration and samples guides have been updated.
      An user manual for the new tool has been provided by Alexander, and

      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java
      implementation of <strong>JMS</strong> (Java Message Service API
      released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.). It provides access to a MOM
      (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the <a
      href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent</a> agents based
      distributed platform.</p>
      <p> JORAM, the MOM it gives access to and the Scalagent
      platform are <strong>open source</strong> softwares and released under
      the <strong>LGPL</strong> license.</p>
