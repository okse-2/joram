      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java
      implementation of <strong>JMS</strong> (Java Message Service API
      released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.). It provides access to a MOM
      (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the <a
      href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent</a> agents based
      distributed platform.</p>
      <p> JORAM is an <strong>open source</strong> software released under
      the <strong>LGPL</strong> license.</p>

	<subtitle>January 10, 2005: JORAM 4.2 release candidate 1 is available</subtitle>
	<p>Joram 4.2 RC1 provides new features as high-availability, dynamic configuration, 
        and a lot of fixes and improvements.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>High Availability</strong> Joram V4.2 provides the active replication of Joram servers and 
          underlying agent servers, as well as replicated JORAM clients. It transparently handles network handover 
          and server failover. This version currently relies on the use of  JGroups.</li>
	  <li><strong>Dynamic Configuration</strong> Joram V4.2 provide facilities to remotely add and remove Joram
          servers dynamically, using the Joram Administration API. This key feature, combined with upgraded JMX 
          implementation, initiates a new set of management facilities for Joram.</li>
	  <li><strong>Architecture and Performance improvements</strong>. Joram V4.2 provides a packaged version of
          a wide set of deep changes within the Joram and underlying bus architectures that lead to performance 
          improvements compared to prior version V4.1. Communication protocols are concerned by this evolution, thus 
          preventing backward compatibility with prior Joram versions.</li>
	</ul>
        <p>This version has been sponsored by France Telecom R&amp;D</p>
	<p> Sponsoring helps maintain a high quality message oriented middleware available to the community and makes
        its constant evolution a reality that anyone can benefit from. Contact the joram-team@objectweb.org if you want
        to participate and sustain the shared development effort of JORAM as the enterprise-class alternative to 
        proprietary messaging system.</p>

	      </li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
