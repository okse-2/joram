      <subtitle>August 7, 2003: JORAM 3.6 connects J2ME devices!</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.6 follows the 3.4 release in addressing the opening of the
      JORAM platform to <strong>heterogenous</strong> client applications.
      Where JORAM 3.4, with the support of SOAP as client communication
      protocol, opened the platform to non-Java applications, the 3.6 release,
      with its new kJORAM libraries, allows J2ME applications to use JORAM
      messaging functionnalities. A J2ME application is a lightweight Java
      application deployed and running on a mobile device such as a PDA or a
      smart phone.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="download/index.html">download area</a> you will find
      the usual JORAM sources and jars-only packages
      (<code>joram-3.6.0-src.tgz</code> and <code>joram-3.6.0.tgz</code>).
      You will also find two new packages holding the specific kJORAM client
      interfaces for the J2ME applications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>kjoram-3.6.0-src.tgz</code>, providing the kJORAM sources and
            sample;</li>
        <li><code>kjoram-3.6.0.tgz</code> providing the kJORAM libraries and
            sample.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>JORAM and kJORAM are also available through a CVS checkout, tag
        <strong>joram3_6_0</strong>.</p>
      <p>The installation and samples guides have been updated to help you
      having an easy and quick first go with kJORAM. Enjoy!</p>
      <subtitle>June 24th, 2003: JORAM 3.5 is available under the
                LGPL licence!</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.5 is available in the CVS repository (joram3_5_0 tag) as well
      as packaged. This version is based on the 3.4 release and
      includes the <strong>SOAP</strong> proxy. On top of that, it provides
      a totally refactored <strong>message persistence</strong> management.
      </p>
      <p>The latest 3.4 update (joram3_4_3) has also been packaged.</p>
      <p>The details of all the modifications and bug corrections which occured
      to the 3.4 release can be found in the
      <a href="dev/versions.html">releases page</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="doc/index.html">Documentation</a> has been updated.
      Particularly, a comparison between the 3.4 and the 3.5 releases
      performances may be found.</p>
      <p>
      JORAM is now released under the <strong>LGPL</strong> licence.</p>

      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java
      implementation of <strong>JMS</strong> (Java Message Service API
      released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.). It provides access to a MOM
      (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the <a
      href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent</a> agents based
      distributed platform.</p>
      <p> JORAM, the MOM it gives access to and the Scalagent
      platform are <strong>open source</strong> softwares and released under
      the <strong>LGPL</strong> license.</p>
