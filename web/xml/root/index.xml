      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java
      implementation of <strong>JMS</strong> (Java Message Service API
      released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.). It provides access to a MOM
      (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the <a
      href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent</a> agents based
      distributed platform.</p>
      <p> JORAM is an <strong>open source</strong> software released under
      the <strong>LGPL</strong> license.</p>

	<subtitle>May 13, 2005: JORAM 4.2.3 maintenance release and 4.3 preview</subtitle>
	<p>The JORAM 4.2.3 maintenance release is now available for download. It basically includes
           bug fixes, their complete list is available in the 
           <a href="dev/versions.html">Code Update</a> page. </p>
	<p>The next JORAM 4.3 version will include new features :</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>JMX management improved and extended,</li>
	  <li>Performance improvments,</li>
	  <li>Handling of large message transmission (called swap out mode),</li>
	  <li>Complete SSL support with handling of encrypted client to server communications.</li>
	</ul>


	<subtitle>March 31, 2005: JORAM 4.2 final release is available</subtitle>
	<p>The Joram 4.2 release features high availability, enhanced management facilities and improved performances.
        </p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>High Availability</strong> Joram 4.2 provides the active replication of Joram servers and 
          underlying agent servers, as well as replicated JORAM clients. It transparently handles network handover 
          and server failover. This version currently relies on the use of  JGroups.</li>
	  <li><strong>Dynamic Configuration</strong> Joram 4.2 provide facilities to remotely add and remove Joram
          servers dynamically, using the Joram Administration API. This key feature, combined with upgraded JMX 
          implementation, initiates a new set of management facilities for Joram.</li>
	  <li><strong>Upgraded JMX management</strong></li>
	  <li><strong>Architecture and Performance improvements</strong>. Joram V4.2 provides a packaged version of
          a wide set of deep changes within the Joram and underlying bus architectures that lead to performance 
          improvements compared to prior version V4.1. Communication protocols are concerned by this evolution, thus 
          preventing backward compatibility with prior Joram versions.</li>
	  <li><strong>JDK 1.5 support</strong></li>
	</ul>

        <p>This version has been partly sponsored by France Telecom R&amp;D</p>
	<p> Sponsoring helps maintain a high quality message oriented middleware available to the community and makes
        its constant evolution a reality that anyone can benefit from. Contact the joram-team@objectweb.org if you want
        to participate and sustain the shared development effort of JORAM as the enterprise-class alternative to 
        proprietary messaging system.</p>
