    <s1 name="Introduction">
      
      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java implementation of <strong>JMS 1.1</strong>
      (Java Message Service API released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.) specification.<br></br>
      It provides access to a really distributed MOM (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the
      <a href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent D.T.</a> agents based platform.</p>
      
      <p>JORAM is a mature project started in 1999, it is an <strong>open source</strong> software released under
      the <strong>LGPL</strong> license since May 2000.<br></br>
      It provides a production ready distributed MOM already used within many critical operational applications.</p>

      <p>Joram is now designed with an OSGi<sup>TM</sup> based services architecture to provide a dynamically adaptable
      messaging server:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Joram server can be launched as a set of OSGi bundles (it is always possible to launch the server as
        a classic Java program).</li>
        <li>Additional services can be started, stopped, reconfigured: Command line interface, Web console, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Stable versions of JORAM are JMS 1.1 certified. Moreover JORAM is used by JOnAS to undergo the Java EE 5
      certification, and has passed all tests concerning JMS 1.1 certification in this J2EE TCK.<br></br>
      Professional Support is available from
      <a href="http://www.scalagent.com/en/joram-33/services-35/support">Scalagent D.T.</a>.</p>

          can now be defined in XML configuration scripts.
        </li>
        <li>

            <li>Add elements to define either an AMQP or JMS bridge connection to a Joram server
            through the XML cpnfiguration scripts.</li>
            <li>Add methods to add or delete either an AMQP or JMS bridge connection to a Joram
            server through the administration API.</li>
          </ul>

	      <p>A two-day training session about JORAM is scheduled in Grenoble; it will be delivered in french language.</p>
	      <p>The session is entitled "Design and Deploy a Distributed JORAM Messaging System".</p>
	      <p>This training session is targeted at architects and system designers that intend to integrate  the JORAM component
	      within a global distributed solution. It includes a significant part of  experimentations and case studies based on
	      real-world application scenarios.</p>
	      <p>The session is conducted by ScalAgent Distributed Technologies, the leading developer of the JORAM component. We
	      offer to share our expertise through a training session aiming at providing the key knowledge to use and deploy a JORAM
	      system that fits your own requirements. This two-day session details the design principles of JORAM and describes the
	      best practices that will enable to take advantage of its advanced properties for complex networked environments.</p>
