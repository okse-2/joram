      <subtitle>March 19th, 2003: new JORAM releases.</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.3 is now available as a packaged version.
      As a reminder, it provides a new administration implementation. In CVS it
      is now tagged joram3_3_1. Compared to joram3_3_0, it is a maintenance
      version, correcting a few bugs.
      </p>
      <p>JORAM 3.4 is available only in the CVS distribution. This
      release tagged joram3_4_0 supports the SOAP protocol as a link between
      a Joram client and a Joram platform. It rearchitectures the JMS proxy
      server side, and the JMS connection client side, for supporting multiple 
      protocols (currently TCP and SOAP).
      </p>
      <p>Both versions features are detailed in the
      <a href="dev/versions.html">releases page</a> and
      <a href="doc/index.html">documented</a>.</p>

      <subtitle>December 11th, 2002: a new JORAM version tagged 3_3_0 is
      available in the CVS distribution.</subtitle>
      <p>This new version provides a refactored <em>administration</em> 
      protocol. Administration is now based on JMS communication and is much
      more flexible than the past implementation. Hopefully it will make
      contributing easier; JORAM's administration still misses graphical tools
      and JMX support, and any contribution would be highly appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>This new administration implementation comes with a new administration
      interface. Old administration codes should go on working even if they now
      use deprecated methods. 
      </p>

      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java
      implementation of <em>JMS</em> (Java Message Service API
      released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.). It provides access to a MOM
      (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the <a
      href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent</a> agents based
      distributed platform. JORAM is a <em>free</em>, <em>open
      source</em> initiative.</p>

      <s2 name="Specification">

        <p>JORAM provides full support to <em>JMS 1.1</em>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unified interfaces for the Point-to-Point (PTP) and
            Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) messaging models</li>
          <li><em>AND</em> still the semantically specific PTP and Pub/Sub
            interfaces</li>
          <li>Full backward compatibility with JMS 1.0.2b compliant
            applications</li>
          <li>TCP and SOAP (HTTP/XML) client-server communication
              protocols</li>
          <li>Hierarchical topics</li>
          <li>Message selection</li>
          <li>Plus a timer for pending transacted sessions</li>
          <li>"Clusterizable" topics</li>
          <li>Configurable dead message queue feature</li>
          <li>Monitoring methods</li>
          <li>Plus a "light" JNDI 1.1.2 implementation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>JORAM also implements the ASF interfaces and methods for
          performing JMS operations through an application server, and
          is integrated to <a
            href="http://jonas.objectweb.org/">JOnAS</a> EJB 
	  platform.</p>
