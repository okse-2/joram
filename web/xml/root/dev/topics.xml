      <subtitle>Administration refactoring</subtitle>
      <p>A wide interest has been shown in the refactoring of
      JORAM's administration. This topic includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The refactoring of the administration interface as well as
        of the internal communication protocol.</li>
        <li>The development of a graphical tool for allowing easier and
        friendlier admin work.</li>
        <li>Supporting JMX for allowing an easier administration of JORAM
            inside JOnAS.</li>
      </ul>

      <subtitle>kJoram: a light Joram for portable devices</subtitle>
      <p>The aim of this work is to provide to client applications running
      on portable devices a gate for accessing Joram messaging
      functionnalities. This work includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The development of an HTTP/SOAP proxy in Joram's server for
        allowing external communications based on HTTP and XML.</li>
        <li>The development of a JMS-like client interface for applications
        running on J2ME.</li>
      </ul>
      
    </s1>

      <p>Contributors already started to work. Many thanks to all of them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fernando Rocha and Jose Carlos Waeny developed
        a GUI prototype based on the current admin interface:
        <a href="../download/adminGUI.zip">try it !</a></li>
        <li>Jeff Mesnil provided us with an insight of what administration
        looks like when based on JMX:
        <a href="../download/adminJMX.zip">try it !</a></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A first sketch of the administration interface is also available
        <a href="../download/AdminItf.java">there</a> .</li>

    <s1 name="kJoram">
    <p>All the work on this topic has been done by Alexandre Gimard and Sylvain
    Treboz at INRIA in Grenoble. They managed to develop the proxy server side
    and the client interface and successfuly tested it.</p>
    <p>Their work is still based on Joram's and JMS' old versions, and will be
    adapted to the latest releases.</p>
