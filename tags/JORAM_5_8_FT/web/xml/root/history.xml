      Serge Lacourte (<a href="www.scalagent.com">ScalAgent D.T.</a>) presents two very different Use Cases of Joram.
      They demonstrate the ability of Joram to adapt to very different deployment environments,
      thanks to the very high configuration capability of its architecture.</p>
      <p>
      The slide show is available on the OW2 web site:

      <p>This release introduces some improvements and bug fixes, essentially:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design of an extension framework for JMS destinations. In a first time it
				defines 2 destinations for acquisition (create JMS message from external data)
				and distribution (create external data from JMS message) and a simple interface
				to implement for acquisition and distribution modules.</li>
        <li>Implementation of Acquisition and Distribution modules are provided to replace
        Collector, Mail, Monitoring and JMS bridge destinations.</li>
        <li>Implementation of a STOMP proxy allowing Joram access through STOMP protocol.</li>
        <li>Possibility to create or retrieve destinations using symbolic name through
        Session.create[Queue|Topic].</li>
        <li>Adds many monitoring and statistics JMX attributes.</li>
        <li>Numerous changes in administration offering better functionnalities and
        performances.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: in the JMS bridge, previously the use of receiveNoWait cause a NPE in
				server and an infinite wait for the client.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: Potential client blocking when sending a message with a TTL to a local
        destination (A cause of this problem can be a bad clock synchronization).</li>

      <s2 name="May 18, 2010: JORAM Architecture Designer plugin 1.0.0 is available">
      <p>The first official release of Joram Architecture Designer plugin for Eclipse is available
      for <a href="http://joram.ow2.org/download/index.html">download</a> (package JORAM_DESIGNER at
      the end of the page). A brief PDF installation guide is available for download.</p>
      <p>As described in the <a href="http://joram.ow2.org/doc/tutorials.html">tutorial</a> the designer
      allows to graphically build a Joram distributed architecture. It produces <code>a3servers.xml</code>
      and <code>joramAdmin.xml</code> configuration files. Now, it allows to automatically deploy the
      designed configuration using <a href="http://fdf.gforge.inria.fr/">DeployWare</a>.</p>

      <s2 name="May 10, 2010: JORAM in OW2 Open Source Cloudware Initiative.">
      <p>Last week, OW2 Consortium members Bull, Orange and INRIA had announced the OW2 Open Source Cloudware Initiative
      at the Solutions Datacenter Management and Cloud Computing trade show in Paris. The bedrock of the OSC Initiative
      includes the following open source OW2 projects: CLIF, Entropy, JASMINe, JOnAS, and <strong>JORAM</strong> to provide
      the capability for on-demand JavaEE autonomic server provisioning according to demand fluctuations and ProActive for
      complementary heterogeneous capacity management.</p>

      <s2 name="May 07, 2010: JORAM 5.3.1 maintenance release is available">
      <p>This release introduces some improvements and bug fixes, essentially:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A reworked PoolNetwork component with one Sender by NetSession. This optimizes
        performances and fixes various synchronization issues. Furthermore, SoftReferences
        are now used in the PoolNetwork to avoid memory errors when messages accumulate in
        the network.</li>
        <li>Interceptors can now be configured for managed connection factories.</li>
        <li>Bug fixes in JMS bridge allowing anew the use of persistent server (a configuration
        parameter is now required to enable XAConnection).</li>
			  <li>Bug fix about destination using Timer. These destinations are now locked in memory
        and the Timer tasks are handled depending of the agent life-cycle.</li>
        <li>Potential bug fix in heart-beat handling. Previously an exception in HeartBeatTask.start
        method caused an Engine stop.</li>
        <li>Potential bug fix avoiding deadlock in AdminModule.stopServer of local server.</li>
        <li>Changes configuration properties naming for NGTransaction.</li>
      </ul>

      messaging server:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Joram server can be launched as a set of OSGi bundles (it is always possible to launch the server as
        a classic Java program).</li>
        <li>Additional services can be started, stopped, reconfigured: Command line interface, Web console, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This release also introduces some improvements and bug fixes, essentially:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Update Joram security JAAS implementation.</li>
        <li>Implements either implicit (periodic) or explicit behavior for monitoring topics.</li>
