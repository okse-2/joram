 * The <code>MonitoringTopic</code> class allows administrators to create acquisition
 * topic for JMX monitoring data.
 * <p>
 * A monitoring acquisition destination is an acquisition destination configured to
 * transform JMX monitoring information into JMS messages. It works in 2 modes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the acquisition.period attribute is set (value greater than 0) the destination
 * periodically scans the selected JMX attributes and generates a message with the value
 * of these attributes.</li>
 * <li>In the other case, the user must send to the destination a message with the list
 * of JMX attributes to scan and the destination creates a message with these values, or
 * use the last known JMX attributes.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each message is delivered to all registered subscribers.
 * <p>
 * This topic is based on JMX monitoring so you must enable JMX monitoring to use it.

   * of JMX attributes that will be monitored. The property key is the name of the MBean and the value is a
