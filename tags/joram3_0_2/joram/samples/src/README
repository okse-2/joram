d. Running the admin:
Type:
	ant cluster_admin

e. Running the subscriber on server1:
Type:
	ant subscriber10

f. Running the first subscriber on server2:
Type:
	ant subscriber20

g. Running the second subscriber on server2:
Type:
	ant subscriber21

h. Running the publisher:
Type:

files.

a. Starting server0:
Type:
	ant server0

b. Starting server1:

Type:
	ant archi_receiver

f. Running the subscriber on server2:
Type:
	ant archi_sub
