   * A set of properties is used to configure the distribution destination:<ul>

   * <li>persistent - Tells if produced messages will be persistent, default is true (JMS default).</li>
   * <li>expiration - Tells the life expectancy of produced messages, default is 0 (JMS default time to live).</li>
   * <li>priority - Tells the JMS priority of produced messages, default is 4 (JMS default).</li>
   * <li>acquisition.max_msg - The maximum number of messages between the last message acquired by the handler
   * and the message correctly handled by the acquisition destination, default is 20. When the number of messages
   * waiting to be handled is greater the acquisition handler is temporarily stopped. A value lesser or equal to
   * 0 disables the mechanism.</li>
   * <li>acquisition.min_msg - The minimum number of message to restart the acquisition, default is 10.</li>
   * <li>acquisition.max_pnd - The maximum number of pending messages on the acquisition destination, default is 20.

   * <li>amqp.ConnectionUpdatePeriod - Period between two update phases allowing the discovering of new
   * Connections. Default value is 5000.</li>
   * <li>amqp.Queue.DeclarePassive – If true declare a queue passively; i.e., check if it exists but do not
   * create it. If false the queue is created if it does not exist. Default value is true.</li>
   * <li>amqp.Queue.DeclareExclusive – If true we are declaring an exclusive queue (restricted to this
   * connection). Default value is false.</li>
   * <li>amqp.Queue.DeclareDurable – If true we are declaring a durable queue (the queue will survive a server
   * restart). Default value is true.</li>
   * <li>amqp.Queue.DeclareAutoDelete – If true we are declaring an “autodelete” queue (server will delete it
