   * A set of properties is used to configure the distribution destination:<ul>
   * <li>period – Tells the time to wait before another distribution attempt. Default is 0, which
   * means there won't be other attempts.</li>
   * <li>distribution.batch –  If set to true, the destination will try to distribute each time every waiting
   * message, regardless of distribution errors. This can lead to the loss of message ordering, but will
   * prevent a blocking message from blocking every following message. When set to false, the distribution
   * process will stop on the first error. Default is false.</li>
   * <li>distribution.async - If set to true, the messages are asynchronously forwarded through a daemon.</li>
   * <li>amqp.ConnectionUpdatePeriod - Period between two update phases allowing the discovering of new
   * Connections. Default value is 5000.</li>
   * <li>amqp.Queue.DeclarePassive – If true declare a queue passively; i.e., check if it exists but do not
   * create it. If false the queue is created if it does not exist. Default value is true.</li>
   * <li>amqp.Queue.DeclareExclusive – If true we are declaring an exclusive queue (restricted to this
   * connection). Default value is false.</li>
   * <li>amqp.Queue.DeclareDurable – If true we are declaring a durable queue (the queue will survive a server
   * restart). Default value is true.</li>
   * <li>amqp.Queue.DeclareAutoDelete – If true we are declaring an “autodelete” queue (server will delete it
   * when no longer in use). Default value is false.</li>
   * <li>amqp.Routing - This property allows to filter the connections used to forward the messages. It can
   * be set either globally at creation or specifically for a message at sending.</li>
