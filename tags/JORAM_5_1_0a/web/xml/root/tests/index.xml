      <subtitle>15th April 2002: Test Suite web pages and package available</subtitle>
      <p>The Test Suite has now its own web pages.</p>
      <p>As requested by some people, it is now also
        available as a <a href="../download/tests.tgz">package</a>.</p>
    </s1>
    <s1 name="About">
      <p>This Test Suite is available under LGPL.
        It tests JMS features and its code base is
        <em>pure JMS without dependency from any vendor</em>.
      </p>
      <p>Technically, the administration step is done through a simple interface
        that any provider can implement. For the moment, we provide
        implementations for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../index.html">JORAM</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.ashnasoft.com/">AshnaMQ</a></li>
        <li><a
            href="http://fiorano.com/best_cgi/frame.cgi?target=products/fmq_tour.htm">FioranoMQ</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.pramati.com/">Pramati</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.swiftmq.com/">SwiftMQ</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>We suggest that other JMS providers implement this
        interface so that the suite can be used by potential users to test
        implementations with respect to well known test scenarios.
