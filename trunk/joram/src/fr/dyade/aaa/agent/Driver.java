/**
 * Abstract base class for drivers such as <code>DriverIn</code> used by
 * <code>ProxyAgent</code>.
 * <p>
 * Multithreading in the agent server is special, as the code executed
 * outside of the main engine thread is no longer part of a transaction.
 * The class <code>Driver</code> has been designed to help programming in
 * a separate thread in the agent server.
 * <p>
 * A key difference between the main thread and a driver thread is the semantics
 * of sending a notification. When in the main thread of the agent server,
 * a notification is sent as part of an agent reaction. It is then part of
 * a transaction, and is actually sent only when the transaction commits.
 * When in a separate thread, the <code>directSendto</code> function of class
 * <code>Channel</code> is used instead, actually creating a new transaction
 * for the single purpose of sending the notification. When the function returns
 * the notification sending has been committed. The function <code>sendTo</code>
 * in this class encapsulates the call to the special <code>Channel</code>
 * function, and should be used by derived classes.
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to be derived. Derived classes should define the
 * function <code>run</code>, providing the actual code to be executed in the
 * separate thread, and may define the function <code>end</code>, providing
 * finalizing code executed when the thread terminates. The <code>end</code>
 * function is always called, even when the <code>run</code> function raises
 * an exception.
