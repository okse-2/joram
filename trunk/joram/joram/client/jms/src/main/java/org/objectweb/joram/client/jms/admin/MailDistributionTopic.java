   * A set of properties is used to configure the distribution destination:<ul>
   * <li>period – Tells the time to wait before another distribution attempt. Default is 0, which
   * means there won't be other attempts.</li>
   * <li>distribution.batch –  If set to true, the destination will try to distribute each time every waiting
   * message, regardless of distribution errors. This can lead to the loss of message ordering, but will
   * prevent a blocking message from blocking every following message. When set to false, the distribution
   * process will stop on the first error. Default is false.</li>
   * <li>distribution.async - If set to true, the messages are asynchronously forwarded through a daemon.</li>
   * <li>smtpServer - the DNS name or IP address of the SMTP server.</li>
   * <li>from - the email address of the sender.</li>
   * <li>to, cc, bcc - a comma separated list of recipients.</li>
