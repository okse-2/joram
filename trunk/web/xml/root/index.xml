      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java implementation of <strong>JMS 1.1</strong>
      (Java Message Service API released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.) specification.<br></br>
      It provides access to a really distributed MOM (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the
      <a href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent D.T.</a> agents based platform.</p>
      
      <p>JORAM is a mature project started in 1999, it is an <strong>open source</strong> software released under
      the <strong>LGPL</strong> license since May 2000.<br></br>
      It provides a production ready distributed MOM already used within many critical operational applications.</p>

      <p>Stable versions of JORAM are JMS 1.1 certified. Moreover JORAM is used by JOnAS to undergo the J2EE 1.4 certification,
      and has passed all tests concerning JMS 1.1 certification in this J2EE TCK.<br></br>

	      <p>A two-day training session about JORAM is scheduled in Grenoble; it will be delivered in french language.</p>
	      <p>The session is entitled "Design and Deploy a Distributed JORAM Messaging System".</p>
	      <p>This training session is targeted at architects and system designers that intend to integrate  the JORAM component
	      within a global distributed solution. It includes a significant part of  experimentations and case studies based on
	      real-world application scenarios.</p>
	      <p>The session is conducted by ScalAgent Distributed Technologies, the leading developer of the JORAM component. We
	      offer to share our expertise through a training session aiming at providing the key knowledge to use and deploy a JORAM
