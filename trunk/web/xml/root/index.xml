      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java
      implementation of <strong>JMS</strong> (Java Message Service API
      released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.). It provides access to a MOM
      (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the <a
      href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent</a> agents based
      distributed platform.</p>
      <p> JORAM is an <strong>open source</strong> software released under
      the <strong>LGPL</strong> license.</p>

			 </li>
			 <li>The clustered queue feature provides a load-balancing mechanism. It is made up of several queues
			  exchanging messages depending on their load. This new feature is sponsored by France Telecom R&amp;D,
				as will be the future High-Availability Joram server to be released in the next version. </li>
			 </ul>
			 <p>JORAM 4.1 is used by JOnAS to undergo the J2EE 1.4 certification, and has already passed all tests

			<subtitle>October 20-21: JORAM Training Session, Grenoble, France</subtitle>
			<p>A two-day training session on JORAM is scheduled and will be delivered in french language.
			 The session is entitled "Design and Deploy a Distributed JORAM Messaging System".</p>
		  <p>This training session is targeted at architects and system designers that intend to integrate 
			the JORAM component within a global distributed solution. It includes a significant part of 
			experimentations and case studies based on real-world application scenarios.</p>
			<p>The session is conducted by ScalAgent Distributed Technologies, the leading developer 
			of the JORAM component. We offer to share our expertise through a training session that provides
			 the key knowledge to use and deploy a JORAM system that fits your requirements.
			This two-day session details the design principles of JORAM and describes the best practices 
			to take advantage of its advanced properties in complex networked environments.</p>
			<p>Detailed information about this training session is available online
