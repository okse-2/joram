     <subtitle>10th june 2002: JORAM now implements the new JMS 1.1
        specification!</subtitle>
      <p><em>Joram 3.1.0 fully implements JMS 1.1</em> providing unified
        messaging interfaces for the Point-to-Point and Pub/Sub
        domains. In the previous versions of Joram and JMS, the
        client programming model made a strong distinction between
        these two domains. Now, the domain unification simplifies
        the model and allows to include PTP and Pub/Sub messaging in
        a same transaction.</p>
      <p>No need to modify existing applications: code written for
        the previous Joram and JMS versions will work as is with
        these new versions.</p>

      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java implementation of
      <em>JMS</em> (Java Message Service API released by Sun Microsystem,
      Inc.). It provides access to a MOM (Message Oriented Middleware), built on
      top of the <em>Scalagent</em> agents based distributed platform. JORAM is
      a <em>free</em>, <em>open source</em> initiative.</p>

      <s2 name="Specification">

        <p>JORAM provides full support to <em>JMS 1.1</em>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unified interfaces for the Point-to-Point (PTP) and
            Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) messaging models</li>
          <li><em>AND</em> still the semantically specific PTP and Pub/Sub
            interfaces</li>
          <li>Full backward compatibility with JMS 1.0.2b compliant
            applications</li>
          <li>Message selection</li>
          <li>Plus a timer for pending transacted sessions</li>
          <li>Plus a distributed Topic destination</li>
          <li>Plus a "light" JNDI 1.1.2 implementation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>JORAM also implements the ASF interfaces and methods for
          performing JMS operations through an application server, and
          is integrated to <a
            href="http://www.objectweb.org/jonas/">JOnAS</a> EJB 
	  platform.</p>
      </s2>

      <s2 name="Getting involved">
	
	<p>Any input or personal view for improving and/or developing
	JORAM is welcome. JORAM, as an <em>open source</em> project,
