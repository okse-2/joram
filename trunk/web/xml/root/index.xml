    <s1 name="Introduction">
      
      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java implementation of <strong>JMS 1.1</strong>
      (Java Message Service API released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.) specification.<br></br>
      It provides access to a really distributed MOM (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the
      <a href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent D.T.</a> agents based platform.</p>
      
      <p>JORAM is a mature project started in 1999, it is an <strong>open source</strong> software released under
      the <strong>LGPL</strong> license since May 2000.<br></br>
      It provides a production ready distributed MOM already used within many critical operational applications.</p>

      <p>Joram is now designed with an OSGi<sup>TM</sup> based services architecture to provide a dynamically adaptable
      messaging server:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Joram server can be launched as a set of OSGi bundles (it is always possible to launch the server as
        a classic Java program).</li>
        <li>Additional services can be started, stopped, reconfigured: Command line interface, Web console, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Stable versions of JORAM are JMS 1.1 certified. Moreover JORAM is used by JOnAS to undergo the Java EE 5 certification,
      and has passed all tests concerning JMS 1.1 certification in this J2EE TCK.<br></br>
      Professional Support is available from <a href="http://www.scalagent.com/spip.php?article313">Scalagent D.T.</a>.</p>

      <s2 name="March 28, 2011: JORAM 5.5.0 release is available.">
      <p>This release introduces some improvements and bug fixes, essentially:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of an AMQP bridge mechanism based on acquisition / distribution
        destinations. The implementation allows load-balancing and fail-over through
        multiples AMQP providers.
        A detailed description is available in section 4.6.10 of the
        <a href="doc/Joram-en.pdf">user's guide</a>.</li>
        <li>Achievement of an interception mechanism for processing messages in the MOM.
        Interceptors can be located on destinations and on connection in/out channels.
        A detailed description is available in section 3.5 of the
				<a href="doc/Joram-en.pdf">user's guide</a>.</li>
        <li>Implementation of a recovery mechanism for the JCA connector with automatic reconnection.</li>
        <li>Enhancements on clustering destinations.</li>
        <li>Configuration for the default syncOnWrite mechanism on persistence handling.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: Removes useless timeout during JNDI service stop.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This version is available for <a href="http://joram.ow2.org/download/index.html">download</a>,
      and in Maven repository.</p>
      <p>This version is bundled in Jonas 5.2.</p>

      <s2 name="October 27, 2010: JORAM 5.4.0 release is available.">
      <p>This release introduces some improvements and bug fixes, essentially:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design of an extension framework for JMS destinations. In a first time it
				defines 2 destinations for acquisition (create JMS message from external data)
				and distribution (create external data from JMS message) and a simple interface
				to implement for acquisition and distribution modules.</li>
        <li>Implementation of Acquisition and Distribution modules are provided to replace
        Collector, Mail, Monitoring and JMS bridge destinations.</li>
        <li>Implementation of a STOMP proxy allowing Joram access through STOMP protocol.</li>
        <li>Possibility to create or retrieve destinations using symbolic name through
        Session.create[Queue|Topic].</li>
        <li>Adds many monitoring and statistics JMX attributes.</li>
        <li>Numerous changes in administration offering better functionnalities and
        performances.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: in the JMS bridge, previously the use of receiveNoWait cause a NPE in
				server and an infinite wait for the client.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: Potential client blocking when sending a message with a TTL to a local
        destination (A cause of this problem can be a bad clock synchronization).</li>
      </ul>

      <s2 name="May 18, 2010: JORAM Architecture Designer plugin 1.0.0 is available">
      <p>The first official release of Joram Architecture Designer plugin for Eclipse is available
      for <a href="http://joram.ow2.org/download/index.html">download</a> (package JORAM_DESIGNER at
      the end of the page). A brief PDF installation guide is available for download.</p>
      <p>As described in the <a href="http://joram.ow2.org/doc/tutorials.html">tutorial</a> the designer
      allows to graphically build a Joram distributed architecture. It produces <code>a3servers.xml</code>
      and <code>joramAdmin.xml</code> configuration files. Now, it allows to automatically deploy the
      designed configuration using <a href="http://fdf.gforge.inria.fr/">DeployWare</a>.</p>
      <p>This release is tagged in SVN (JORAM_DESIGNER_1_0_0).</p>

      <s2 name="May 10, 2010: JORAM in OW2 Open Source Cloudware Initiative.">
      <p>Last week, OW2 Consortium members Bull, Orange and INRIA had announced the OW2 Open Source Cloudware Initiative
      at the Solutions Datacenter Management and Cloud Computing trade show in Paris. The bedrock of the OSC Initiative
      includes the following open source OW2 projects: CLIF, Entropy, JASMINe, JOnAS, and <strong>JORAM</strong> to provide
      the capability for on-demand JavaEE autonomic server provisioning according to demand fluctuations and ProActive for
      complementary heterogeneous capacity management.</p>

      <s2 name="May 07, 2010: JORAM 5.3.1 maintenance release is available.">
      <p>This release introduces some improvements and bug fixes, essentially:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A reworked PoolNetwork component with one Sender by NetSession. This optimizes
        performances and fixes various synchronization issues. Furthermore, SoftReferences
        are now used in the PoolNetwork to avoid memory errors when messages accumulate in
        the network.</li>
        <li>Interceptors can now be configured for managed connection factories.</li>
        <li>Bug fixes in JMS bridge allowing anew the use of persistent server (a configuration
        parameter is now required to enable XAConnection).</li>
			  <li>Bug fix about destination using Timer. These destinations are now locked in memory
        and the Timer tasks are handled depending of the agent life-cycle.</li>
        <li>Potential bug fix in heart-beat handling. Previously an exception in HeartBeatTask.start
        method caused an Engine stop.</li>
        <li>Potential bug fix avoiding deadlock in AdminModule.stopServer of local server.</li>
        <li>Changes configuration properties naming for NGTransaction.</li>
      </ul>

	      <p>A two-day training session about JORAM is scheduled in Grenoble; it will be delivered in french language.</p>
	      <p>The session is entitled "Design and Deploy a Distributed JORAM Messaging System".</p>
	      <p>This training session is targeted at architects and system designers that intend to integrate  the JORAM component
	      within a global distributed solution. It includes a significant part of  experimentations and case studies based on
	      real-world application scenarios.</p>
	      <p>The session is conducted by ScalAgent Distributed Technologies, the leading developer of the JORAM component. We
	      offer to share our expertise through a training session aiming at providing the key knowledge to use and deploy a JORAM
	      system that fits your own requirements. This two-day session details the design principles of JORAM and describes the
	      best practices that will enable to take advantage of its advanced properties for complex networked environments.</p>

      This will be built automatically from the current development code after each change in the SVN code base.</p>
      <p>If you need quickly a fix for a particular bug, you may be able to find a fixed Joram release here well
      before the fix makes it into the next release version. On the other hand, these snapshots might sometimes
      be unstable.</p>
