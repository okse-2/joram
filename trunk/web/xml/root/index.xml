      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java
      implementation of <strong>JMS</strong> (Java Message Service API
      released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.). It provides access to a MOM
      (Message Oriented Middleware), built on top of the <a
      href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent</a> agents based
      distributed platform.</p>
      <p> JORAM is an <strong>open source</strong> software released under
      the <strong>LGPL</strong> license.</p>

	<subtitle>September 20-21, 2005: JORAM Training Session, Grenoble, France</subtitle>
	<p>A two-day training session on JORAM is scheduled and will be delivered in french language.
	The session is entitled "Design and Deploy a Distributed JORAM Messaging System".</p>
	<p>This training session is targeted at architects and system designers that intend to integrate 
	the JORAM component within a global distributed solution. It includes a significant part of 
	experimentations and case studies based on real-world application scenarios.</p>
	<p>The session is conducted by ScalAgent Distributed Technologies, the leading developer 
	of the JORAM component. We offer to share our expertise through a training session that provides
	 the key knowledge to use and deploy a JORAM system that fits your requirements.
	This two-day session details the design principles of JORAM and describes the best practices 
	to take advantage of its advanced properties in complex networked environments.</p>
	<p>Detailed information about this training session is available online

	<subtitle>March 31, 2005: JORAM 4.2 final release is available</subtitle>
	<p>The Joram 4.2 release features high availability, enhanced management facilities and improved performances.
        </p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>High Availability</strong> Joram 4.2 provides the active replication of Joram servers and 
          underlying agent servers, as well as replicated JORAM clients. It transparently handles network handover 
          and server failover. This version currently relies on the use of  JGroups.</li>
	  <li><strong>Dynamic Configuration</strong> Joram 4.2 provide facilities to remotely add and remove Joram
          servers dynamically, using the Joram Administration API. This key feature, combined with upgraded JMX 
          implementation, initiates a new set of management facilities for Joram.</li>
	  <li><strong>Upgraded JMX management</strong></li>
	  <li><strong>Architecture and Performance improvements</strong>. Joram V4.2 provides a packaged version of
          a wide set of deep changes within the Joram and underlying bus architectures that lead to performance 
          improvements compared to prior version V4.1. Communication protocols are concerned by this evolution, thus 
          preventing backward compatibility with prior Joram versions.</li>
	  <li><strong>JDK 1.5 support</strong></li>
	</ul>

        <p>This version has been partly sponsored by France Telecom R&amp;D</p>
	<p> Sponsoring helps maintain a high quality message oriented middleware available to the community and makes
        its constant evolution a reality that anyone can benefit from. Contact the joram-team@objectweb.org if you want
        to participate and sustain the shared development effort of JORAM as the enterprise-class alternative to 
        proprietary messaging system.</p>
