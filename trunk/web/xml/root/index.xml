      <subtitle>March 19th, 2003: new JORAM releases.</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.3 is now available as a packaged version.
      As a reminder, it provides a new administration implementation. In CVS it
      is now tagged joram3_3_1. Compared to joram3_3_0, it is a maintenance
      version, correcting a few bugs.
      </p>
      <p>JORAM 3.4 is available only in the CVS distribution. This
      release tagged joram3_4_0 supports the SOAP protocol as a link between
      a Joram client and a Joram platform. It rearchitectures the JMS proxy
      server side, and the JMS connection client side, for supporting multiple 
      protocols (currently TCP and SOAP).

      <p><strong>JORAM</strong> incorporates a 100% pure Java
      implementation of <em>JMS</em> (Java Message Service API
      released by Sun Microsystem, Inc.). It provides access to a MOM

      href="http://www.scalagent.com/">ScalAgent</a> agents based
      distributed platform. JORAM is a <em>free</em>, <em>open
      source</em> initiative.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Unified interfaces for the Point-to-Point (PTP) and
            Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) messaging models</li>
          <li><em>AND</em> still the semantically specific PTP and Pub/Sub
            interfaces</li>
