      <subtitle>March, 11th 2002: JORAM 3.0 available</subtitle>
      
      <p><em>JORAM 3.0 is now available for download</em>. Documentation has also been
	updated and new samples are provided.<br />
	Compared to JORAM previous versions, this new release is a complete
	re-factoring of the code base. It gets rid of the
	previous limitations and defects. The JMS specification is now fully
	implemented, JORAM provides authentication and security
	features, and introduces a distributed implementation of the Topic
	destination. Its clean and sound code basis guarantees fast
	and easy future developements and enhancements.<br/>
	A suite of tests based on JUnit will be very soon proposed for
	download.<br />
	Please do not hesitate to keep us informed of any inconsistancy or
	problem you may encounter with the new distribution and documentation.<br />
	We sincerely hope you will enjoy this new version.   
      </p>

      <subtitle>March, 6th 2002: </subtitle>
      
      <p>The new version of JORAM will be commited in CVS. Since this
      version is a complete rewrite of JORAM, some problems may occur
      when commiting into CVS. CVS may be in a inconstitent state for
      the next two days. Thus we recommend anyone using CVS to avoid
      to checkout JORAM for the next two days. As soon as the CVS is
      ok, we will warn you.
      </p>
