      <subtitle>January 7, 2005: JORAM 4.2 release candidate 1 is available</subtitle>
      <p>Joram 4.2 RC1 provides new features as high-avaibility, dynamic configuration, 
        and a lot of fixes and improvements.</p>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>High Availability</strong> This version provides the active replication of JORAM clients, 
          JORAM servers and ScalAgent servers. It transparently handles network handover and server 
          failover. This version currently relies on JGroups.</li>
	<li><strong>Dynamic Configuration</strong> This version provides a runtime mechanism enabling to 
          remotely add and remove Joram servers dynamically, at runtime, through the Administration API of JORAM.
          This great feature, combined with updated JMX implementation, initiates a new set of management facilities in JORAM
          </li>
	<li><strong>Architecture and Performance improvements</strong>. This version packages a whole set of deep
          changes within the JORAM and ScalAgent architectures that lead to performance improvements compared to the 4.1 
          version. Those changes partially concern communication protocols and thus prevent backward compatibility with previous
          Joram versions. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This version has been sponsored by France Telecom R&D</p>

      <subtitle>January 7, 2005: JORAM 4.1.5 maintenance release is available</subtitle>

	<li>The Joram 4.1 JCA 1.5 RA, handles:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Inbound (asynchronous message flow) and Outbound (synchronous message flow) communications</li>
	    <li>Support of distributed (XA) and local transactions.</li>
	    <li>Automatic recovery of indoubt Xids via XAResource.recover().</li> 
	    <li>Deployment as a Resource Adapter to an external JORAM server.</li>
	    <li>Deployment in collocated mode : a JORAM server is started and stopped at RA deployment and undeployment.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>The clustered queue feature provides a load-balancing mechanism. It is made up of several queues
	exchanging messages depending on their load. This new feature is sponsored by France Telecom R&D,
	as will be the future High-Availability Joram server to be released in the next version. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>JORAM 4.1 is used by JOnAS to undergo the J2EE 1.4 certification, and has already passed all tests 
	concerning JMS in this TCK.</p>

      <subtitle>February 13, 2004: JORAM 4.0 is released and provides major
      new features!</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 4.0 is the first release of a new JORAM generation with even
      more features and architecturing capabilities.</p>
      <p>This new version introduces the following new
      functionnalities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Collocated communication protocol</strong>: when a client
        and its JORAM server run collocated in a same JVM, they may now
        communicate through a "local" optimised connection rather than a 
        TCP connection. This feature will highly impact the use of JORAM with
        JOnAS for example, when set as collocated.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distributed JNDI server</strong>: this latest version of
        JORAM's naming server may now be deployed on many JORAM servers, 
        so that naming information is accessible from multiple points. 
        Client applications do not depend anymore on a single central JNDI
        server.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Universal JMS bridge</strong>: JORAM may be configured
        for establishing a link to any JMS compliant foreign JMS provider.
        This feature allows JORAM client applications to actually communicate
        with foreign JMS destinations totally transparently.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Administration methods</strong> have been largely 
      modified for simplifying the evolution of management following
      the new JORAM releases. Old admin and monitoring classes
      have been kept but this will be temporary.</p>
      <p>This new version also introduces a <strong>new sources
      tree</strong>, which may be quickly described as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>com/scalagent</code>: sources of the kJoram client
        layer</li> 
        <li><code>fr/dyade/</code>: sources of the agent platform</li>
        <li><code>org/objectweb/joram</code>: sources of the MOM and JORAM
        client layers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>New packages have been released, the CVS tag is
      <strong>joram4_0_0</strong>.</p>

      <subtitle>November 7, 2003: the first major
      contribution from JORAM ever growing community</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.7 includes the long expected graphical tool for
      administering and monitoring the state of a JORAM platform.
      Thanks to Alexander Fedorowicz, an active contributor, this tool is
      made available to the whole JORAM community.</p>
      <p>The tool allows to administer and monitor a JORAM platform made of
      one or many interconnected JORAM servers. It allows to create and delete
      destinations, users, and also to bind them to JORAM's naming server.</p>
      <p>The tool sources are available in CVS and in the sources package. It
      is provided as an independent library in the binary distribution.
      </p>
      <p>This latest release is also available through a CVS checkout, tag
        <strong>joram3_7_0</strong>.</p>

      <subtitle>August 7, 2003: JORAM 3.6 connects J2ME devices!</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.6 follows the 3.4 release in addressing the opening of the
      JORAM platform to <strong>heterogenous</strong> client applications. Where
      JORAM 3.4, with the support of SOAP as client communication protocol,
      opened the platform to non-Java applications, the 3.6 release, with
      its new kJORAM libraries, allows J2ME applications to use JORAM messaging
      functionnalities. A J2ME application is a lightweight Java application
      deployed and running on a mobile device such as a PDA or a smart
      phone.</p>
      <p>kJORAM is available in specific packages and also by checking out
      the <strong>joram</strong> CVS module, tag <strong>joram3_6_0</strong>.
      </p>

      <subtitle>June 24th, 2003: JORAM 3.5 is available.</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.5 is available in the CVS repository (joram3_5_0 tag) as well
      as packaged. This version is based on the 3.4 release and includes
      the <strong>SOAP</strong> proxy.
      On top of that, it provides a totally refactored <strong>message
      persistence</strong> management.
      </p>
      <p>The latest 3.4 update (joram3_4_3) has also been packaged.</p>
      <p>JORAM is now released under the <strong>LGPL</strong> licence.</p>

      <subtitle>March 19th, 2003: new JORAM releases.</subtitle>
      <p>JORAM 3.3 is now available as a packaged version.
     As a reminder, it provides a new administration implementation. In CVS it
     is now tagged joram3_3_1. Compared to joram3_3_0, it is a maintenance
     version, correcting a few bugs.
     </p>
      <p>JORAM 3.4 is available only in the CVS distribution. This
     release tagged joram3_4_0 supports the SOAP protocol as a link between
     a Joram client and a Joram platform. It rearchitectures the JMS proxy
     server side, and the JMS connection client side, for supporting multiple 
     protocols (currently TCP and SOAP).</p>

      <subtitle>December 11th, 2002: a new JORAM version tagged 3_3_0 is
      available in the CVS distribution.</subtitle>
      <p>This new version provides a totally refactored <strong>administration</strong> 
      protocol. Administration is now based on JMS communication and is much
      more flexible than the past implementation. Hopefully it will make
      contributing easier; JORAM's administration still misses graphical tools
      and JMX support, and any contribution would be highly appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>This new administration implementation comes with a new administration
      interface. Old administration codes should go on working even if they now
      use deprecated methods. 
      </p>

     <subtitle>October 21st, 2002: JORAM 3.2 provides new features!</subtitle>
      <p>The main added values of Joram 3.2.0 are the new implementations of
         <strong>hierarchical topics</strong> and <strong>dead message queues</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>According to the JMS specification, topics might have a hierarchical
         structure allowing clients to subscribe or publish to given subtopics.
         Joram's fully distributed structure allows a topic hierarchy to be
         spread over many servers.
      </p>
      <p>A dead message queue is a destination getting undeliverable messages.
         Messages might be considered undeliverable because they expired 
         before delivery, because they were sent on a non accessible
         destination or because they are constantly denied when consumed.
      </p>
      <p>This new version also provides a <strong>flow control mechanism</strong> in
         order to prevent a Joram platform to be overloaded by a heavily
         producing client.
      </p>

     <subtitle>June 10th, 2002: JORAM now implements the new JMS 1.1
        specification!</subtitle>
      <p><strong>Joram 3.1.0 fully implements JMS 1.1</strong> providing unified
        messaging interfaces for the Point-to-Point and Pub/Sub
        domains. In the previous versions of Joram and JMS, the
        client programming model made a strong distinction between
        these two domains. Now, the domain unification simplifies
        the model and allows to include PTP and Pub/Sub messaging in
        a same transaction.</p>
      <p>No need to modify existing applications: code written for
        the previous Joram and JMS versions will work as is with
        these new versions.</p>
      

      <subtitle>7th june 2002: JORAM 3.0.4 available (cvs tag: joram3_0_4-1)</subtitle>
      
      <p>
        This version is a maintenance version of JORAM, it includes
        corrections of bugs in XA and ASF classes. 
        The JORAM CVS repository has been branched after this release:
        next version of JORAM will implement JMS 1.1. The branch
        corresponding to JMS 1.0.2b is jms1_0_2b. 
      </p>


      <subtitle>26th March 2002: JORAM 3.0.1 available (cvs tag: joram3_0_1)</subtitle>
      
      <p>
	This version corrects all bugs discovered by JORAM community
	since the release of JORAM 3.0.0. These corrections were already available
	in CVS repository.
      </p>


      <subtitle>20th March 2002: JMS Test Suite released</subtitle>

      <p><strong>A JMS Test Suite</strong> has been released under LGPL.<br />
	This suite tests JMS features. All code of the test suite is
	pure JMS without any dependency to JORAM.</p>

      <subtitle>11th March 2002: JORAM 3.0.0 available (cvs tag: joram3_0_0)</subtitle>
      
      <p>
	Compared to JORAM previous versions, this new release is a complete
	re-factoring of the code base. It gets rid of the
	previous limitations and defects. The JMS specification is now fully
	implemented, JORAM provides authentication and security
	features, and introduces a distributed implementation of the Topic
	destination. Its clean and sound code basis guarantees fast
	and easy future developements and enhancements.<br/>
	A suite of tests based on JUnit will be very soon proposed for
	download.
      </p>
      

      <subtitle>16th January 2002: JORAM 2.2 (cvs tag:
	joram2_2)</subtitle>
      <p>This version adds support for Ant build
	system.

	<li><strong>New feature:</strong> message selection (see JMS spec section 3.8).</li>
	<li><strong>Bug:</strong> the problem when sending objects not "known" by the agents
	  server inside an ObjectMessage does not occur anymore. No need now to add this
	  object's class in the agents server classpath.</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <subtitle>15th May 2001: JORAM 2.0.1 (cvs tag: joram2_0_1)</subtitle>
      
      <p>This version closely follows the 2.0.0 and provides improvements in the
	management of closing sockets, and a better handling of stopping threads when
	closing <code>Sessions</code>, <code>ConnectionConsumers</code> and <code>Connections</code>.</p>
