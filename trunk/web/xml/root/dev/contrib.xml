    <p>JORAM, as an open source project, welcomes and even expects
       contributions.</p>

    <p>Basically, any feature you need but you do not find implemented in
       JORAM may become a contribution topic. Simply send your ideas,
       documents and developments (if any) to the 
       <a href="mailto:joram-team@objectweb.org">joram team</a> .</p>

    <p>You may also wish to get involved in an already undertaken work. The
       list of hot topics is available
       <connect href="topics.xml">there</connect> .</p>
