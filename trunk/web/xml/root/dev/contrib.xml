    <s1 name="Getting Involved">
  
    <p>JORAM, as an open source project, welcomes and even expects
       <em>contributions</em>.</p>

    <p>Basically, any feature you need but you do not find implemented in
       JORAM may become a contribution topic. Simply send your ideas,
       documents and developments (if any) to the 
       <a href="mailto:joram-team@objectweb.org">JORAM team</a> .</p>

    <p>You may also wish to get involved in an already undertaken work. If not
       already done, you may have a look at the 
       <connect href="topics.xml">current developments page</connect>.</p>
