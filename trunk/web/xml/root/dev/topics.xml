    <s1 name="Administration">
    <p>Tony Thompson has started to work on the <em>configuration</em> of
    a JORAM platform. His goal is to get rid of the current static 
    configuration way based on a XML file, by allowing to start a server
    in a minimum configuration state and configure it through administration
    methods. Tony has suspended his work but hopefully will be able to resume
    soon!</p>
    <p><em>Monitoring</em> capabilities have been added by Frédéric Maistre
    (INRIA). They allow to:</p>
    <ul> 
      <li>get a list of destinations for a given server;</li>
      <li>get a list of users for a given server;</li>
      <li>get a list of readers or writers for a given destination;</li>
      <li>get the number of subscibers on a given topic;</li>
      <li>get the number of pending messages on a given queue;</li>
      <li>get the number of pending "receive" requests on a given queue;</li>
      <li>retrieve a clustered topic architecture;</li>
      <li>retrieve the dead message queue related settings for a given server,
          destination or user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alexander Fedorowicz is developing a <em>graphical</em> interface
       and will soon be able to propose a first version of his work.</p>
    </s1>

    <s1 name="C or C++ client sample">
    <p>The SOAP proxy introduced by version 3.4 allows non Java clients to 
       connect to the MOM. A sample illustrating this ability of JORAM to
       authorize connections between heterogenous worlds would be great!
       <em>Contributions would be highly appreciated!</em></p>
    </s1>

    <s1 name="Performances and Persistence">
    <p>The 3.5 release opens the door to improving Joram's performances and
    providing more flexibility to the persistence of messages.</p>
    <p>Algorithms may still evolve to become more performant. New interfaces
    and classes might be written for allowing the messages to be persisted on
    any other support than the current file based one. <em>Contributions
    are welcome!</em></p>
