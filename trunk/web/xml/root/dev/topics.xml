    <s1 name="Administration">
    <p>Tony Thompson has started to work on the <em>configuration</em> of
    a JORAM platform. His goal is to get rid of the current static 
    configuration way based on a XML file, by allowing to start a server
    in a minimum configuration state and configure it through administration
    methods. Tony has suspended his work but hopefully will be able to resume
    soon!</p>
    <p><em>Monitoring</em> capabilities have been added by Frédéric Maistre
    (INRIA). They allow to:</p>
    <ul> 
      <li>get a list of destinations for a given server;</li>
      <li>get a list of users for a given server;</li>
      <li>get a list of readers or writers for a given destination;</li>
      <li>get the number of subscibers on a given topic;</li>
      <li>get the number of pending messages on a given queue;</li>
      <li>get the number of pending "receive" requests on a given queue;</li>
      <li>retrieve a clustered topic architecture;</li>
      <li>retrieve the dead message queue related settings for a given server,
          destination or user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alexander Fedorowicz is developing a <em>graphical</em> interface
       and will soon be able to propose a first version of his work.</p>

    <s1 name="kJoram">
    <p>Nicolas Tachker (ScalAgent) is developing a light Joram client portable
       on the J2ME environment (kJoram). This client will connect to the Joram
       platform through Enhydra's <em>kSoap</em> protocol. The SOAP proxy
       introduced by the joram 3.4 release is the kSoap entry point for the
       Joram platform.</p>
    </s1>

    <s1 name="Persistence">
    <p>Frédéric Maistre (INRIA) is re-viewing the persistence implementation
       in the Joram platform, mainly for improving the <em>performances</em>
       of the persistent mode.</p>
    <p>Gavin King is working to provide a new persistence mode using
       <em>JDBC</em> and allowing to set a database as persistence support.</p>
